# New Year, New Institutions

In Spring 2025, a few nerds decided to come together to form a special interest groups about protocol-based practices in science. There was a sense that protocols were a cornerstone of knowledge-making practices but where not lacking the theoretical basis to properly study them in their own right. And so, The Protcollege was born out of a loose group of scholars with an interest in the philosophical meta-study of scientific practice. The basis was initially in Munich with some in Copenhagen but has since expanded to cover members from the West Coast of the US all thr way to Australia. Naturally, this makes coordination a bummer and so better infrastructures are needed.

So here is the official site of the PROTOCOLLEGE, a place to consolidate out knowledge and to coordinate beyond the local. The site will host a schedule, activities and outputs as well as artifacts produced during our sessions, from text, to diagrams to art. But most importanty, this will serve as a place to share our protocols. In fact, the aim for this site is to become a template that can be replicated by other protocolleges, mycelial allies in the goal to spread "Protocol Awareness" and literacy for the challanges that the 21st century will bring to our society.

If you wish to enter the Proto-Protocollege you are more than welcome to drop by in one of our public online sessions, send an email or join our communciation channels. Lurkers and Stewards are both welcome; your degree of participation is up to you!
